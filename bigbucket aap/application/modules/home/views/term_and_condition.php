                    <p>Having worked as event managers for long enough, we realized that the task of assembling vendors for organizing events wasn't at all easy. There were, among-st others, social, economic and age barriers – that needed to be collapsed. That's how the idea of TuliA – an advanced events planning app, that would eliminate the hassles of planning successful events was born. </p>
                    <p>We developed this app realizing that for small events vendors and freelancers, the market was a tough nut to crack that would have them relay on references from past customers which was not consistent, thus unreliable and for the users the hustle of calling around to find the right vendor for the right price was time consuming and frustrating.</p>
                    <p>As <b>Tulia</b> we have broken this barrier by allowing all types of vendors weather large or small to register and display their work to users looking for their services. With this, not only has it made it possible for small vendors to compete for the same clients but also opens up the ability for vendors to partner up with each other vendors and collaborate on large events. For users it has opened up a list of vendors that match their budget and also the level of expectation they desire for free .This is the first of its kind Event Vendor Search App</p>
